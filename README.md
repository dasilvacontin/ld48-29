Unfinished game jam entry for the 29th LudumDare. Made with pixi.js in less than 15h. Graphics generated via code.

It will become a turn based game where players play locally on a big screen and send a sequence of actions from their smartphone.

You can test some placeholder actions: 'WASD' for movement, 'QE' for rotation, 'O' for shooting, 'P' for shockwave.
